                <p>Fire needs 'oxygen' to burn and spread heat, while we
                    need O2 to 'Energize and Rise'. It was considered as
                     one of the best festivals in the city with the motto
                   "Breathe it! Live it! Love it!" O2 is known to celebrate
                       talent, potential, direct energy and dedication
                    towards something big. It has always enhanced talent
                       and created a sense of responsibility among the
                     youth. We took of on our journey in 2006, and we
                                   have come a long way!
                       O2 has scaled heights much beyond everyone's
                     expectations, thus setting exceptional standards. A
                       salute to the enthusiastic young souls! Bhavan's
